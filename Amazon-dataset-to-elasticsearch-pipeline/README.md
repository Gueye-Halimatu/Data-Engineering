This project is about downloading a large dataset on Amazon Datasets and load it into an ElasticSearch database, test the pipeline with curl requests. 

**Project Objectives :**
1. *Handling large datasets* : Familiarize yourself with processing and integrating large datasets into a system like Elasticsearch.
2. *Understanding Elasticsearch* : Learn how data indexing and search mechanisms work in Elasticsearch.
3. *Automating with cURL* : Learn to test and interact with Elasticsearch using HTTP requests via cURL for debugging and command-line testing.
4. *Data pipeline* : Develop a complete data processing pipeline, from data retrieval to search queries.
